# Voting form with Node.js

Simple web app that takes your vote, sends it to the Node.js for a check and if it's correct it sends it back to the jsx file and adds it to Local Storage and displays it on the main page.

To run use the following commands:
  npm run dev ( to run the project )
  node server/index.js ( this turns on the backend )
